# PiDay
Python functions to calculate the value of π 


A few days back, March 14th, we celebrated the ‘Pi Day’: 3.14

The definition of π is: The Circumference divided by the Diameter of a Circle.

π	is an irrational number, approximately equal to:3.14159265358979323846…

The digits go on and on with no pattern.

π	has been calculated to fifty trillion decimal places and still there is no pattern to the digits.


A quick and easy approximation for π is 22/7.	22/7 = 3.1428571...

But, 22/7 is not exactly right. In fact, π is not equal to the ratio of any two numbers (it is irrational).


Here is π with the first 100 decimal places:

**Calculating π**

The calculation of π has been revolutionized by the development of techniques of infinite series, especially by mathematicians from Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries.
Here are a few techniques for calculating π:

**Viete's Series**
The first infinite sequence discovered in Europe was an infinite product, found by French mathematician François Viète in 1593:

**Wallis's Series**

The second infinite sequence, found in Europe by John Wallis in 1655, was also an infinite product:

Leibniz's Series

Madhava of Sangamagrama, an Indian mathematician, formulated a series that was rediscovered by Scottish mathematician James Gregory in 1671, and by Leibniz in 1674:

Nilakantha's Series
An infinite series for π published by Nilakantha, an Indian mathematician, in the 15th century is:

Write Python functions to calculate the value of π by using the above series. Choose a number of iterations (100,000 or 500,000 or 1,000,000) for each series, as you see it fit.

**The output should be as follows:**
